Everyone talks how bad the education system is , obdoy does something about it . 
I too have major problems , I hate school and colleges .

Here's my solution . In fact the techonology required is already built . Just implememntation is required.

I first quantified what schools provide and whether those can be made available online.
1)Information 2)Teaching/Learning 3)Community 4)Evaluation with degree/certificate.
Expanding on same -
1) Information is already available on the internet for free, why not allow those same people on the internet with incentives to curate those information under a topic and subject for free for people to study on our site.
2) Teaching - be made available to people the same way coursera and udemy like sites does it.
3) Community - People attending certain courses can join groups with like minded people.
4) Evaluation and Certificates- We can hold exams every year in contact with experts on subjects worldwide and based on the merit we can issue certificates to people.
